        "- The infinite nature of language creates significant challenges for natural language processing and computational linguistics.\n",

        "  - Parts of speech (e.g., nouns, verbs, adjectives, prepositions) are not always straightforward to classify.\n",

        "- Ambiguity is a pervasive feature of natural language, affecting both individual words and sentence structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Types of ambiguity:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Lexical Ambiguity**: A word has multiple meanings (e.g., \"bank\").\n",
        "  - **Syntactic Ambiguity**: Multiple possible structures for a sentence.\n",
        "  - **Semantic Ambiguity**: Different possible interpretations of a sentence's meaning.\n",

        "  - **Syntactic Ambiguity**: The prepositional phrase \"in my pajamas\" can modify either \"shot\" or \"elephant\".\n",
        "  - Resolving such ambiguities is crucial for natural language understanding as different interpretations lead to drastically different meanings.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Context-Free Grammar (CFG) can help analyze ambiguous phrases:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - CFG uses rules to define possible sentence structures.\n",
        "  - Example: \"I shot an elephant in my pajamas\" can be parsed using CFG rules to produce multiple syntax trees.\n",

        "- Another example: \"Visiting relatives can be tiresome.\"\n",

        "  - **Syntactic Ambiguity**: \"visiting\" can be a verb (the action of visiting relatives) or an adjective (describing relatives who are visiting).\n",
        "  - Different interpretations significantly change the meaning of the sentence.\n",

        "  - Develop systematic ways to handle ambiguities.\n",
        "  - Produce accurate representations of sentence structure.\n",
        "  - Leverage formal grammar frameworks like CFG, along with statistical methods and machine learning, to improve parsing and disambiguation in natural language processing applications.\n"

        "\n",
        "   - **Why Fine-tuning Matters**:\n",
        "     - Allows models to specialize in specific tasks, improving accuracy and relevance.\n",

        "   - **1. Starting with a Pre-trained Model**:\n",
        "     - Fine-tuning begins with a model that has been pre-trained on large datasets, such as general web text.\n",
        "     - This foundational training helps the model understand language basics, such as grammar and vocabulary.\n",
        "     - Example: Starting with a pre-trained model like GPT-3 for further tuning on finance data.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **2. Adding Domain-Specific Data**:\n",
        "     - Introduces new data relevant to the specific domain or task (e.g., healthcare, law).\n",
        "     - Fine-tuning adjusts the model’s parameters to make it more accurate within that context.\n",
        "     - Example: Using a dataset of legal documents to fine-tune a model for legal text analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **3. Updating Model Weights**:\n",
        "     - Fine-tuning alters some of the model’s weights, which are the internal parameters that guide its responses.\n",
        "     - Only a fraction of weights are modified, allowing the model to retain its basic language understanding while adapting to the new task.\n",
        "     - Observation: This process allows quick adaptation without needing to change the whole model.\n",

        "   - **1. Full Fine-tuning**:\n",
        "     - Adjusts all layers of the model, adapting it completely to the new data.\n",
        "     - Pros: Highly adaptable to new data, maximizes accuracy.\n",
        "     - Cons: Requires more computational resources and may take longer.\n",
        "     - Example: Fine-tuning all layers of a model for domain-specific tasks like financial forecasting.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **2. Partial Fine-tuning**:\n",
        "     - Only the last few layers of the model are fine-tuned while keeping earlier layers frozen.\n",
        "     - Pros: Faster and uses less memory, retains the model’s general language skills.\n",

        "     - Example: Tuning just the final layers to create a model for movie recommendation.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **3. Adapter-based Fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA - Low-Rank Adaptation)**:\n",
        "     - Introduces small, trainable components (adapters) without changing the core model parameters.\n",
        "     - Pros: Highly efficient, requires minimal memory and computational power.\n",
        "     - Cons: Might not be as precise as full fine-tuning for highly specialized tasks.\n",

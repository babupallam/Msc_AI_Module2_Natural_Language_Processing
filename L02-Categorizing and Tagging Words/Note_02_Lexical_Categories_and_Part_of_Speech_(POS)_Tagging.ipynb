        "  - **Adjectives (ADJ)**: Modify nouns, describing qualities or characteristics (e.g., *blue*, *fast*, *large*).\n",
        "  - **Adverbs (ADV)**: Modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs (e.g., *quickly*, *very*, *smoothly*).\n",
        "  - **Pronouns (PRON)**: Substitute for nouns or noun phrases (e.g., *he*, *she*, *it*).\n",
        "  - **Determiners (DET)**: Introduce nouns (e.g., *the*, *a*, *some*).\n",

        "This distinction is crucial in understanding language dynamics. While open-class words provide most of the content in language (i.e., **lexical words**), closed-class words act as function words, providing grammatical structure.\n",

        "- **Word**: \"fly\"\n",

        "- There are several methods for implementing POS taggers:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Rule-Based Tagging**:\n",
        "    - Involves manually defined rules for assigning tags based on the words and their contexts (e.g., a word ending in \"ing\" might be tagged as a present participle verb).\n",
        "  - **Stochastic/Probabilistic Tagging**:\n",
        "    - Uses statistical models to assign POS tags based on the likelihood of a tag given a word and its surrounding context.\n",

        "        - **Unigram Tagging**:\n",
        "          - Assigns the most frequent tag for each word, ignoring context.\n",

        "- **Out-of-Vocabulary Words**: Unknown or rare words that do not appear in the training data can be difficult to tag correctly.\n",

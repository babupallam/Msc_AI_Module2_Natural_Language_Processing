        "\n",
        "The experimentation and visualization stages provided several valuable insights into the model's behavior and feature engineering choices:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Layer Depth and Over-Smoothing**:\n",
        "  - Increasing the number of layers allows each node to capture information from more distant neighbors. However, beyond a certain depth, embeddings start to converge and become overly similar—a phenomenon known as *over-smoothing*.\n",
        "  - Typically, two to three layers were optimal, capturing sufficient context without losing distinctiveness in node representations.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Feature Selection Matters**:\n",
        "  - The choice and combination of features significantly impacted the model’s performance. Combining embeddings with additional features like Part-Of-Speech (POS) tags helped in capturing both syntactic and semantic information, leading to richer representations.\n",
        "  - Word embeddings alone offered semantically rich representations but sometimes lacked syntactic nuance, which could be mitigated by adding syntactic features like POS tags.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Aggregation Methods**:\n",
        "  - **Mean pooling** provided a balanced view by averaging node embeddings, yielding stable results across tasks.\n",
        "  - **Sum pooling** highlighted longer sentences by giving them a higher magnitude, which can sometimes introduce bias based on sentence length.\n",
        "  - **Max pooling** emphasized the most significant features in each embedding, making it particularly useful in tasks where certain keywords or prominent words drive the context.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Graph Structures**:\n",
        "  - Visualizing graph structures clarified syntactic relationships and highlighted how the model interprets sentence structure based on dependency-based adjacency matrices.\n",
        "  - Observing the connections between words allowed a deeper understanding of dependency parsing's effectiveness in creating meaningful graph structures that capture language syntax and context effectively.\n"

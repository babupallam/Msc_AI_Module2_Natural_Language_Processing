        "- The primary objective is to map textual data into one or more predefined categories based on the content's characteristics.\n",

        "\n",
        "For example:\n",
        "- In **spam detection**, the task is to classify emails as either \"spam\" or \"not spam\" based on the content.\n",
        "- In **sentiment analysis**, the goal is to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) expressed in a piece of text.\n",

        "  - **RNNs** are well-suited for sequence data because they can maintain a hidden state that captures information from previous steps in the sequence. However, vanilla RNNs suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, making it hard for them to capture long-term dependencies.\n",

        "  - **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**:\n",
        "    - LSTMs address the limitations of RNNs by using gating mechanisms to better retain long-term dependencies in the sequence.\n",
        "    - The LSTM cell consists of three gates (input, forget, and output gates) that regulate the flow of information, allowing the model to learn which information to keep or forget.\n",

        "    - This approach is highly effective in NER, as the entity boundaries can be identified more accurately when both preceding and succeeding words are considered.\n",
